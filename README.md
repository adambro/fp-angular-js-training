# Angular JS Training
This application is used for Angular JS training in [Future Processing](http://www.future-processing.com).

## Setup
To run the project, you need to have node.js installed on your machine. Head over to http://nodejs.org/ to get the latest version.

To install the dependencies, open the console, enter the project's directory and type in `npm install`. This will fetch the libraries from the [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/) repository Then you can start the application by `node app`.

## Running the server
Executing `node app` will start up the web server on local port 3000. Open your browser and type in http:\\localhost:3000 in the address bar to see the site.
